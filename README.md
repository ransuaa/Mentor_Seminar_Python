This repository provides the complete workflow and analytical steps used for the research paper titled:
“Trends and Determinants of International Student Migration to Russia”
Author: Rhoda Ansuaa
The project contains Python code used for preparing the dataset, conducting exploratory and statistical analyses, generating visuals, and running regression models. All tables, charts, and model outputs are automatically saved for easy integration into academic reports, presentations, or LaTeX documents.

Repository Structure
•	README.md – overview of the project and instructions for use
•	analysis.py – main script that executes the entire analytical process
•	requirements.txt – list of Python libraries required for running the analysis
•	data/ – directory for storing raw CSV datasets
•	outputs/ – folder where computed summaries, statistical tables, and regression outputs are saved
•	figures/ – directory containing all exported plots generated by the script

Data Requirements (store files inside the data/ directory)
The analysis script is designed to load a CSV file located in the data folder.
Your dataset should include at least the following variables:
•	year
•	total_international_students
•	sending_country
•	field_of_study
•	determinant

Place your data file inside the directory:
C:\Users\PC\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder (2)\data\

How to Execute the Analysis
1.	Download or clone all project files into:
C:\Users\PC\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder (2)
2.	Open a command prompt or terminal window in that directory.
3.	Set up and activate a virtual environment:
4.	Install all required Python libraries:
5.	Run the main analysis script:

Overview of the Script’s Capabilities
The Python script performs the following tasks:
•	Imports and processes the raw dataset
•	Handles missing or incorrectly formatted values
•	Computes descriptive statistics
•	Produces time-series plots 

Automatically exports:
o	Summary statistics
o	All generated charts
